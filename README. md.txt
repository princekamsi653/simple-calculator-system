📘 Standard Calculator System
Course: Software Engineering (SEN)
1. Project Overview

The Standard Calculator System is a simple web-based application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The system was developed following the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to ensure a structured and systematic approach to software development.

2. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
2.1 Requirements Analysis
Functional Requirements

The system shall accept numeric inputs (0–9)

The system shall perform arithmetic operations:

Addition (+)

Subtraction (−)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/)

The system shall display calculation results

The system shall clear all inputs using the clear (C) button

The system shall delete the last input using the delete (DEL) button

The system shall handle invalid expressions by displaying an error message

Non-Functional Requirements

The system shall have a simple and user-friendly interface

The system shall respond quickly to user input

The system shall run on standard web browsers

2.2 System Design

The Standard Calculator System follows a three-layer architectural design:

Presentation Layer
Implemented using index.html. This layer contains the calculator display and buttons used for user interaction.

Styling Layer
Implemented using style.css. This layer defines the visual appearance, layout, and alignment of the calculator components.

Logic Layer
Implemented using script.js. This layer contains the JavaScript functions that handle input processing and arithmetic operations.

All names and nomenclatures used in the design are consistent with those used in the implementation.

2.3 Implementation

The system was implemented using the following technologies:

HTML for structuring the calculator interface

CSS for styling and layout

JavaScript for implementing calculator logic

Key functions implemented in script.js include:

appendValue() – Appends numbers and operators to the display

calculateResult() – Evaluates the mathematical expression and displays the result

clearDisplay() – Clears the calculator screen

deleteLast() – Deletes the last entered character

2.4 Testing

Testing was carried out to ensure correct system behavior:

Button click testing to confirm responsiveness

Arithmetic operation testing for accuracy

Error handling testing for invalid expressions

User interface testing for usability

All detected issues were fixed during the testing phase.

2.5 Deployment

The system was deployed as a static web application and hosted on GitHub.
Users can run the system by opening the index.html file in any modern web browser.

2.6 Maintenance

Future maintenance and improvements may include:

Adding keyboard input support

Implementing advanced calculator functions

Enhancing the user interface design
